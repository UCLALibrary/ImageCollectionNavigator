In an instant, centuries of dream and speculation became reality, and the world watched itself step into the future. In 1969, UCLA has been celebrating its fiftieth anniversary, pointing with pride to a history of tremendous growth and progress. As we step into the future, however, we begin to wonder...will the second fifty years live up to the promise of the first fifty? With the rising costs of education, such progress will be possible only if UCLA enlists broader private support. State funds have increased steadily over the past decade, but proportionate to the total budget, they have decreased about 25%. Your contribution can provide vital unrestricted funds-money to be used where the need is greatest. Every gift, large or small, helps UCLA to achieve its goal of quality in education. The new concept of the Annual Fund was created with the future in mind; it assists in assuring that UCLA will continue to be among the best, not just adequate.   Now is the time to give, because an end-of-the-year contribution may prove to be a tax advantage to you. May I also remind you that a gift of $100 or more qualifies you as a member of the Chancellor's Honor Roll as well as a donor to Annual Fund I.    On behalf of myself and UCLA, let me extend to you my warmest wishes for the holiday season.  Walter Cunningham, National Chairman  UCLA Annual Fund I (July 1, 1969-June 30, 1970)  P.S. If you have already given to Annual Fund I or the Chancellor's Honor Roll, please accept my additional thanks. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The new IBM 7094/1410 system at UCLA's Health Sciences Computing Facility performs in five minutes the approximately 70,000,000 computations necessary to analyze the changes in concentration of 56 blood elements resulting from one stress condition. The computer simulation program used is one developed by James C. DeHaven and Edward C. DeLand, of the RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, working with Dr. Maloney and Dr. Gilbert B. Bradham, NIH Fellow, UCLA School of Medicine. Dr. Maloney said mathematical models of complex biochemical systems may one day enable the computer to simulate and analyze biochemical structures with more speed, precision and economy than is possible now using conventional laboratory methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
